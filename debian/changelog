supertux (0.3.0~dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #404676).
  * Ack previous NMU, thanks to Martin Michlmayr.
  * Licensing:
     - Updated copyright by diffing both 0.1.3 and 0.3.0 upstream tarballs,
       added missing GPL headers, updated author and contributor lists.
     - DFSGified version by removing data/sound and data/music from the
       upstream tarball since the licenses are not clear for those files. The
       upstream authors are clarifying this on a wiki page, so we hope we'll
       be able to release a 0.3.0-1 version with all DFSG-free content (thus
       the choice of the tilde a DFSG separator).
     - Added both --disable-sfx and --disable-music options to the command in
       the desktop and the menu files accordingly.
  * Set Maintainer field to `pkg-games-devel'. Added myself as an Uploader.
  * Added a B-D on libphysfs-dev and libopenal-dev.

    debian/rules.
  * Added a build conflict against nvidia-glx-legacy.
  * Adapted install rule, using jam's -sprefix option.

  * Adapted dh_install* parameters:
     - removed `ChangeLog'
  * Removed from debian/docs:
     - NEWS
     - TODO
     - LEVELDESIGN
     - AUTHORS
  * Removed some manuals `cp', but added one to handle the .desktop file,
    waiting for a better solution.
  * Updated versioned dependency on the data package.
  * Updated debian/menu icon path as well as the .desktop one.
    (Closes: #341432, #394222)
  * Made use of .install files and -i/-a parameters to build the packages
    correctly.
  * Bumped Standards-Version from 3.6.2 to 3.7.2 (no change needed).
